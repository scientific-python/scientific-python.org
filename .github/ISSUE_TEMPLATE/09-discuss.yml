        The most common reason for creating a new category is that you want a "mailing list" for your open source Scientific Python community project.
        If this is the case, please provide a link to the source repository and license.
        Also specify if you want a public developer list and / or a public user list.
        Finally, if you want a private list for sensitive developer discussions, you will need to tell us the discourse login name of who you want to own the private list.
