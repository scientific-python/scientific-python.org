  - summary: Make Your Own JupyterLab Extension
    description: |
      Make your own JupyterLab extension in this tutorial. JupyterLab is a free and open source, browser based integrated development environment (IDE) that is the successor to Jupyter Notebook. Designed from the core to be extensible, JupyterLab is itself an extension of the Jupyter framework. Since its release, open source developers have contributed hundreds of third party extensions (652 third-party extensions as of 2024-10-15).

  - summary: Polars & Narwhals - Understanding Expressions When You're Used to pandas
    description: |
      When it comes to dataframes, pandas is the go-to library for
      many people. Yet Polars is taking the world by storm, and so
      many data practitioners are curious about trying it out. There
      is a learning curve though, as Polars introduces some concepts
      which pandas users might not be familiar with. This talk is a
      deep dive into one of those concepts (expressions) and will focus
      on how you can understand them from a pandas perspective.
