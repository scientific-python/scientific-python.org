        features:
        - title: Built on Python
          text: SciPy provides algorithms for optimization, integration, interpolation, eigenvalue problems, algebraic equations, differential equations, statistics and many other classes of problems.
        - title: Extensive and high quality
          text: The algorithms and data structures provided by SciPy are broadly applicable across domains.
        - title: Widely used in science
          text:  Extends NumPy providing additional tools for array computing and provides specialized data structures, such as sparse matrices and k-dimensional trees.
        - title: Loosely coordinated
          text: SciPy wraps highly-optimized implementations written in low-level languages like Fortran, C, and C++. Enjoy the flexibility of Python with the speed of compiled code.
        - title: Community / Open development
          text: SciPy's high level syntax makes it accessible and productive for programmers from any background or experience level.
        - title: Open source
          text: Distributed under a liberal [BSD license](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/master/LICENSE.txt), SciPy is developed and maintained [publicly on GitHub](https://github.com/scipy/scipy) by a vibrant, responsive, and diverse [community](/dev-zone).
