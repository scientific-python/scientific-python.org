With an extensive and high-quality ecosystem of libraries, scientific Python
has emerged as the leading platform for data analysis.
This ecosystem is sustained by independent volunteers with separate mailing
lists, websites, roadmaps, documentation, engineering and packaging solutions,
and governance structures.

To better coordinate the ecosystem and prepare scientific Python
for the next decade of data science, we will:

1. Create recommendation infrastructure for community-wide policy,
2. Improve common engineering infrastructure,
3. Organize a series of developer events to discuss needs,
4. Write a community vetted strategic plan, and
5. Help the community develop grant proposals.

During the first half of 2021, we will focus on creating a recommendation
infrastructure for community-wide policy and on improving common engineering
infrastructure (see the [Scientific Python Ecosystem Coordination (SPEC)]({{<
relref "specs" >}}) documents).
