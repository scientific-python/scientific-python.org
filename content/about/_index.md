With an extensive and high-quality ecosystem of libraries, scientific Python
has emerged as the leading platform for data analysis.
This ecosystem is sustained by independent volunteers with separate mailing
lists, websites, roadmaps, documentation, engineering and packaging solutions,
and governance structures.

This project aims to better coordinate the ecosystem and prepare scientific Python
for the next decade of data science.

# People

As a coordinating effort, the Scientific Python project has several teams that operate across the ecosystem.
For more information, see our [governance and decision making process]({{< relref "/about/governance" >}}).
