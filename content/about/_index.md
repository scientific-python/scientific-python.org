This is the main website of the _Scientific Python project_.

{{< notice mission >}}
To better coordinate the ecosystem and support the community of contributors and maintainers.
{{< /notice >}}

The scientific Python _ecosystem_ is a loose federation of community-developed and -owned Python projects widely used in scientific
research, technical computing, and data science.
The scientific Python _community_ of contributors and maintainers are employed by a variety of universites, research labs, and companies.
Historically, the community has been composed primarily of volunteers working in their free-time over nights and weekends.
Given the growing importance of these tools, funding to work on these projects has been increasing.
However, volunteers continue to drive the development of these tools.
This is true, in particular, because existing funding is largely short-term and not certain to continue.

## Ecosystem Projects

There are a numerous projects that use Python for computing, but we focus specifically on projects that are:

- **Science focused**

  Tools used by students, researchers, and scientists for teaching and discovery that are openly shared with the public.

- **Open source**

  Distributed under unrestrictive open source licenses, projects are developed and maintained publicly and accessible to all.

- **Community-driven**

  Projects are developed by open communities composed primarily of the users of the software.

## Who we are

Learn more about the [community]({{< relref "/community" >}}) that
powers Scientific Python.

## What We Do

- **SPECs**
  [Scientific Python Ecosystem Coordination]({{< relref "/specs" >}})
  documents are a mechanism by which practices are
  discussed and propagated throughout the ecosystem.
- **Summits**
  At the [summits]({{< relref "/summits" >}}), we get together both virtually and in-person
  to plan and do ecosystem work.
- **Development Guide**
  Read this [community-maintained guide](https://learn.scientific-python.org/development/)
  to learn best practices for library development.
- **Lecture Notes**
  Learn or teach with these [classroom-style lecture notes](https://lectures.scientific-python.org) on the scientific Python ecosystem.
- **Sparse Arrays**
  One of our current focuses is on improving and maintaining the
  sparse array capabilities and inter-operability in the ecosystem.
- **Community**
  Our [community efforts]({{< relref "/community" >}}) focus
  on broadening participation and better coordinating volunteer efforts.

<!--
- **Tools**
  We maintain a collection of [tools]({{< relref "/tools" >}})
  used across the ecosystem.

## Leadership

The following people are involved with leading the overall project.
For more information, see our [governance and decision making process]({{< relref "/about/governance" >}}).

### Other Teams

As a coordinating effort, the Scientific Python project has several teams that operate across the ecosystem.
Specific projects may have their own governance structures.
For example, the SPEC Steering Committee governance model is described [here]({{< relref "/specs/steering-committee/" >}}).
