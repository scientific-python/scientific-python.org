The scientific Python _ecosystem_ is a loose federation of community
developed and owned Python projects widely used in scientific
research, technical computing, and data science.

This is the main website of the _Scientific Python project_, which
aims to better coordinate the ecosystem and grow the community.

## Ecosystem Projects

There are a numerous projects that use Python for computing, but we focus specifically on projects that are:

- **Built on Python**

  Python is a powerful, general-purpose programming language. The scientific Python ecosystem provides the tools that make Python the premier language for scientific computing.

- **Open source**

  Distributed under unrestrictive open source licenses, projects are developed and maintained publicly and accessible to all.

- **Community-driven**

  Projects are developed by open communities composed primarily of the users of the software.

- **Extensive and high quality**

  The scientific Python ecosystem comprises performant, well-tested libraries providing tools for computing across all scientific domains.

- **Broadly applicable**

  The ecosystem is widely used in scientific research and teaching.

- **Coordinated, readable, reproducible**

  Projects in the ecosystem are completely interoperable, providing the basis for readable, reproducible scientific computation.
