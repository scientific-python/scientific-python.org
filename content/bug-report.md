Report Bugs
===========

**Please help us by reporting any problems you find.**

Projects in the SciPy Stack all have their own bug trackers, on which
issues can be reported. Questions and feature requests are best sent to
the mailing list of the project it concerns.

Please report bugs, documentation errors etc., in the following
trackers:

-   [NumPy issues](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues)
-   [SciPy issues](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues)
-   [Matplotlib issues](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues)
-   [IPython issues](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues)
-   [pandas issues](https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues)
-   [SymPy issues](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues)

For problems with this scipy.org website, use the bug tracker for the
[scipy.org website project](https://github.com/scipy/scipy.org/). This
*excludes* [docs.scipy.org](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/): problems in
docs should be reported to the project which the document describes.

Guidelines for submitting bugs
------------------------------

-   Provide a good description. Tickets in the vein of \"SciPy is
    BROKEN!!!\" are not useful; rather, please state the problem
    clearly, e.g., \"scipy.ndimage ignores keyword \'axis\'\".

-   Include a minimal standalone code snippet to illustrate the problem.
    Try to narrow it down to a few lines.

-   If you experience segfaults or memory errors, give a GDB traceback:

        $ gdb python
        GNU gdb 6.3.50-20050815 (Apple version gdb-573) (Fri Oct 20 15:50:43 GMT 2006)

        This GDB was configured as "i386-apple-darwin"...Reading symbols for shared
        libraries .. done
        (gdb) run -c "import scipy; scipy.test(10,10)"
        Starting program: /usr/local/bin/python -c "import scipy; scipy.test()"
        Reading symbols for shared libraries . done
        Program received signal SIGTRAP, Trace/breakpoint trap.

    Then use the \"bt\" command after the segfault happens to get the
    backtrace. Alternatively, run the code using
    [Valgrind](http://valgrind.org/).
