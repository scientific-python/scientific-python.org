title: "Code of Conduct"
---

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the scientific Python
ecosystem project, including all public and private mailing lists,
issue trackers, wikis, and any other communication channel used by our
community.

This code of conduct should be honored by everyone who participates in the
scientific Python ecosystem community formally or informally, or
claims any affiliation with the project, in any project-related activities and
especially when representing the project, in any role.

This code is not exhaustive or complete.
It serves to distill our common understanding of a collaborative, shared
environment and goals.
Please try to follow this code in spirit as much as in letter, to create a
friendly and productive environment that enriches the surrounding community.

## Specific Guidelines

We strive to:

1.  Be open.
    We invite anyone to participate in our community.
    We prefer to use public methods of communication for project-related messages,
    unless discussing something sensitive.
    This applies to messages for help or project-related support, too; not only
    is a public support request much more likely to result in an answer to a
    question, it also ensures that any inadvertent mistakes in answering are more
    easily detected and corrected.

2.  Be empathetic, welcoming, friendly, and patient.
    We work together to resolve conflict, and assume good intentions.
    We may all experience some frustration from time to time, but
    we do not allow frustration to turn into a personal attack.
    A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.

3.  Be collaborative.
    Our work will be used by other people, and in turn
    we will depend on the work of others.
    When we make something for the benefit of the project, we are willing to explain
    to others how it works, so that they can build on the work to make it even better.
    Any decision we make will affect users and colleagues, and we take
    those consequences seriously when making decisions.

4.  Be inquisitive.
    Nobody knows everything!
    Asking questions early avoids many problems later, so we encourage
    questions, although we may direct them to the appropriate forum.
    We will try hard to be responsive and helpful.

5.  Be careful in the words that we choose.
    We are careful and respectful in our communication and
    we take responsibility for our own speech.
    Be kind to others.Do not insult or put down other participants.
    We will not accept harassment or other exclusionary behaviour, such as:

    - Violent threats or language directed against another person.
    - Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
    - Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
    - Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
    - Sharing private content, such as emails sent privately or non-publicly,
      or unlogged forums such as IRC channel history, without the sender's consent.
    - Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
    - Unwelcome sexual attention.
    - Excessive profanity.
      Please avoid swearwords; people differ greatly in their sensitivity to swearing.
    - Repeated harassment of others.
      In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
    - Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.

## Diversity Statement

The scientific Python ecosystem project welcomes and encourages participation by everyone.
We are committed to being a community that everyone enjoys being part of.
Although we may not always be able to accommodate each individual's preferences,
we try our best to treat everyone kindly.

No matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you.
Though no list can hope to be comprehensive, we explicitly honour diversity in:
age, culture, ethnicity, genotype, gender identity or expression, language,
national origin, neurotype, phenotype, political beliefs, profession, race, religion,
sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, subculture and technical ability.

Though we welcome people fluent in all languages, scientific Python ecosystem
development is conducted in English.

Standards for behaviour in the scientific Python ecosystem community are
detailed in the Specific Guidelines above.
Participants in our community should uphold these standards in all their
interactions and help others to do so as well.

## Reporting Guidelines

We know that it is painfully common for internet communication to start
at or devolve into obvious and flagrant abuse.
We also recognize that sometimes people may have a bad day, or be unaware of
some of the guidelines in this Code of Conduct.
Please keep this in mind when deciding on how to respond to a breach of this Code.

For clearly intentional breaches, report those to the Scientific Python
Ecosystem Core Team (see below).
For possibly unintentional breaches, you may reply to the person and point out
this code of conduct (either in public or in private, whatever is most
appropriate).
If you would prefer not to do that, please feel free to report to the
Scientific Python Ecosystem Core Team directly, or ask the Team for advice, in
confidence.

You can report issues to the
[Scientific Python Community Managers](/about/#community-managers),
at <community-managers@discuss.scientific-python.org>.

<!--
If your report involves any members of the Team, or if they feel they
have a conflict of interest in handling it, then they will recuse
themselves from considering your report. Alternatively, if for any
reason you feel uncomfortable making a report to the Team, then you
can also contact:

-   Senior [NumFOCUS
    staff](https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct#persons-responsible):
    <conduct@numfocus.org>.
-->

## Incident reporting resolution and enforcement

We will investigate and respond to all complaints.
The Scientific Python Ecosystem Core Team will protect the identity of the
reporter, and treat the content of complaints as confidential (unless the
reporter agrees otherwise).

In case of severe and obvious breaches, e.g., personal threat or
violent, sexist or racist language, we will immediately disconnect the
originator from Scientific Python Ecosystem communication channels.

In cases not involving clear severe and obvious breaches of this code of
conduct, the process for acting on any received code of conduct
violation report will be:

1.  acknowledge report is received
2.  reasonable discussion/feedback
3.  mediation (if feedback didn't help, and only if both reporter and
    reportee agree to this)
4.  enforcement via transparent decision by the Scientific Python Ecosystem
    Core Team

The Team will respond to any report as soon as possible, and at most
within 72 hours.
