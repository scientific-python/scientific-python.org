## Choosing a project to work on

How should you choose which project to work on?
There are many projects in the ecosystem to choose from so it’s important to find one related to something you’re interested in or is a project you already use.
For example, if you’re interested in working with images, it might be worth looking into implementing algorithms in scikit-image.

Typically, it is easier to contribute to smaller projects---but you also want to choose a project that’s active enough so that the developers can review your code and provide mentorship.
There may also be more issues and ideas to work on.

Before diving into a project, take a look at their open issues and pull requests, see how maintainers interact with the community, and decide if it would be good fit for you.

For a more detailed discussion, also take a look at our `Choosing a project` video, linked below.

## Tools to learn

As with any trade, there are certain fundamental tools you should learn.
Since the ecosystem is built in Python, you'll need to know how to program in that language.
Other tools we use daily include:

- git and Github
- the command-line terminal, and
- a good editor.

Take a look below for links on how to learn these tools.

## First contribution

Now that you’ve chosen a project to contribute to, it’s time to get set up.
Most projects have a file called CONTRIBUTING in the root of the repository that will tell you how to set up your development environment, propose changes, etc.
Developer documentation will also explain testing and review procedures, and whatever else you need to know.

When first contributing to a project, it’s best to start with small, self-contained issues.
Often, maintainers will label issues with the "good first issue" label, so take a look at those first.
Examples of a good first issue include fixing a small bug, adding tests, fixing documentation typos, or writing up simple documentation.

It is not uncommon to get stuck while making your first contribution.
Don't panic!
Try to find the real-time chat or discussion forum for the project, and ask for assistance there.
The maintainers will be happy to help!

For more details, also check out our `First contribution` video.

## What's next

Once you’re comfortable making small changes to the project, you can start taking on bigger features.
There are many different ways to help: you may, e.g., implement new features, write documentation, refactor and clean up code, improve testing, work on build infrastructure, and so forth.

No matter what you contribute, or whether you contribution is big or small, it is much appreciated.
