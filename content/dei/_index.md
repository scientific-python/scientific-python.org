We believe that healthy communities are built when everyone's voice is heard,
when their perspective is valued, and when their work is recognized.
It is also evident that better technical and social
solutions can be found through wide participation.
We are therefore dedicated to expanding our community in a welcoming and inclusive way,
with particular focus on increased participation from minorities underrepresented in STEM.

Community members must adhere to our [code of conduct]({{< relref "/code_of_conduct.md" >}}).

## Diversity & Inclusion in Scientific Computing (DISC) group

We work closely with NumFOCUS'
[Diversity & Inclusion in Scientific Computing (DISC) group](https://numfocus.org/programs/diversity-inclusion).
