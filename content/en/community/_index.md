Healthy communities are built when everyone's voice is heard,
when their perspective is valued, and when their work is recognized.
Better technical and social solutions can be found through wide participation.
We are therefore dedicated to expanding our community in a welcoming and inclusive way,
with particular focus on increased participation by people who identify with groups that are
underrepresented in STEM and the open source scientific Python community.

Community members must adhere to our [code of conduct]({{< relref "/code_of_conduct.md" >}}).

## Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

- [Diversity & Inclusion in Scientific Computing (DISC) group](https://numfocus.org/programs/diversity-inclusion)

## How to contribute

The scientific Python ecosystem welcomes your expertise and enthusiasm!
