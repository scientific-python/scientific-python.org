## Contributing to a Scientific Python project

A common question from new contributors is: "how do I choose which project to
contribute to"?
Some people end up contributing to many different projects, whereas others
tend to focus their effort on a single project.
Ultimately, the most important factors in this decision are your own personal
goals and interests!
The projects in the ecosystem have a lot in common; however, it is important to
recognize the each project has it's own community, so there may be differences
in the overall goals and decision-making processes for each project.

## Understanding the project

Some projects (e.g., NumPy) are used by many projects in the ecosystem.
Often these projects are mature and relatively full-featured.
Given there central role in the ecosystem, working on these projects can have a huge impact.
However, making large changes to these projects may be more challenging than in newer
and less central projects.
It’s not uncommon for even core developers to have pull requests going through iterations for months before being merged.

For example, because NumPy affects pretty much the entire ecosystem, it is going to be very difficult to contribute larger features to and usually requires a NumPy Enhancement Proposal (NEP) to be approved before work is started on it.
Enhancement Proposals are fairly common for core projects in the ecosystem and consist of a writeup of the planned changes, including a summary of the implementation, pros and cons of it, and sometimes a proof of concept coded up.
It is then discussed and iterated on before a decision is made.

On the other hand, other projects such as NetworkX may just require a review or two and basic tests before your changes are merged.
This is important to keep in mind when picking out a project to work on.

## Contributing to the ecosystem

The open source Scientific Python community functions differently from a normal work environment because it is largely comprised of people contributing from different timezones in their free time.
As such, it’s important to recognize that contributors and maintainers may not always be consistent when they’re able to work or get back to you.

Since so many members are volunteers, any and all contributions are highly valued.
Sometimes people may miss out on notifications or read something and forget to respond, so if you haven’t heard back from them in a few days, it’s usually safe to ping them to check that they didn’t miss anything.

## Learn more about a project

Getting to know the developer community is a great way to learn more about the
projects and find a great fit.
There are many ways to begin interacting with project communities:
 - Most projects have a developer mailing list.
 - Many projects also have other communication channels for developers and
   newcomers, such as slack and discord.
 - Projects often have community meetings for developers or newcomers.
 - Consider [watching a project on GitHub][gh-watching].
