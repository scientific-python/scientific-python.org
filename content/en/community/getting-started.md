## Choosing a project to work on

Choosing a project to contribute to can be daunting.
There are many projects in the ecosystem to choose from so it’s important to find one related to something you’re interested in or is a project you already use.
For example, if you’re interested in Computer Vision, it might be worth looking into implementing algorithms in scikit-image.

It’s typically easier to contribute to smaller projects but you also want to choose a project that’s big and active enough so that you have mentorship opportunities and room to grow.
It’s also a good idea to take a look at open issues and pull requests, see how maintainers interact with the community, and assess if it would be good for you.

Some tools you should learn:
- Github
- Git
- Terminal
- Anaconda or miniconda
- Editor or IDE

You can find help to learn these tools in the links below the video:

## Getting your foot in the door

So now that you’ve chosen which project to contribute to, it’s time to get set up.
Most projects have a file called CONTRIBUTING in the root of the repository that will tell you how to set up your development environment, submit pull requests, etc.
Other developer documentation will also explain the testing process and other breakdowns of the project.

When first contributing to a project, it’s best to start with small, self-contained issues.
Oftentimes, maintainers will label issues as a “good first issue,” so you should take a look at those first.
Some examples of a good first issue include fixing a small bug, adding tests, fixing documentation typos, or writing up simple documentation.

## Taking on bigger features

Once you’re more comfortable contributing to the project, you can start taking on bigger features.
You can browse the open issue list for ideas such as small feature requests, writing documentation regarding how a system works, and minor refactoring like factoring out common code, deprecating old functionality, and renaming & reorganization.
