## 5 ways to contribute to open source without coding

<!--
Hello everyone, I’m Juanita.
Welcome to the Scientific Python videos! Today I will be sharing with you some ways in which you can contribute to open source software projects without actually having to code.
-->

Open source software is code designed in a way that it is accessible to the public, everyone can view, modify, and distribute it easily, according to the terms of permissive software licenses.
It relies on peer review and community production.
This is why you can engage in the open source community easily and contribute in any way that you feel comfortable.

### Issue testing and triaging

Every open source project has its own issue tracker where users post bugs, UX improvements, or any other issues they are having.
This allows support and improvement of projects.
One way in which you can contribute is by testing and triaging these issues by doing the following:	

1. Check if older bugs are still present and comment on older issues to say they were solved and in which version of the software.
2. Find duplicate issues and link related ones since usually the same issues are opened several times by many users.
3. Add good self-contained reproducers to issues helping developers to find a reliable way to test them.
4. Label issues correctly by adding tags to them.
This usually requires triage rights but you can just ask for them!

### Reviewing PRs

Pull requests (PRs) are the way in which OS projects add new code to their codebase.
You can help even if you’re not familiar with it by:

1. Summarizing discussions in PRs so that new contributors can be aware of the main points without reading the whole thread.
2. Test proposed changes in PRs to make sure they don’t break any other functionality.

### Improving documentation

Documentation is crucial to every open source project since it is the way in which users can learn everything about it.
One way to contribute to a project is by improving it’s documentation.
This doesn’t mean you need to write new documentation (which you can by following the docs contributing guide), but there are other ways you can help.

1. Many projects have tutorials which you can review and report confusing or missing parts.
2. Find typos and minor errors in docs and report them in the docs repository issue tracker.
3. If you feel like creating your own content, you can write your own guides and tutorials.
There are several materials you can produce: how-to’s, deep-dive explanations, examples, notebooks, videos, etc...
4. Improving docstrings within the code, and improving documentation style and design is also helpful.


### Translations

Most Open source projects are developed in English, but many use platforms to translate their interface, webpage, or documentation.
If you speak another language and feel comfortable translating, this is a way you can help.
Projects use platforms as Transifex, weblate, or crowdin where you can join as a volunteer contributor.


### Participating in the community

Every open source project has its own community which you can be part of.
You can get involved in online conversations and discussions about the projects, offer help to others, come to community meetings, or teach others about the project.
You can even help with community outreach by sharing content on Twitter, organizing code sprints, participating in the newsletter or writing blogs.

There are many ways to contribute to open source projects so if you can think of another one, feel free to reach out to maintainers and I’m sure they will be happy to receive all the help they can get.
