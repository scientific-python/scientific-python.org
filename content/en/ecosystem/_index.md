Scientific Python is both an **ecosystem** of software libraries and tools
as well as a **community** of contributors who maintain the software and
support the scientists, students, and others users.

## Ecosystem Packages

Here is a curated selection of packages available in the ecosystem:

### Core

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), the fundamental package for
  numerical computation. NumPy defines the n-dimensional array data structure,
  the most common way of exchanging data within packages in the ecosystem.
- [SciPy](https://scipy.org),
  a collection of numerical algorithms and domain-specific toolboxes,
  including signal processing, optimization, statistics, and much
  more.
- [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), a mature and popular plotting
  package that provides flexible, publication-quality 2-D and 3-D visualization.

### Data and computation

- [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), providing high-performance,
  easy-to-use data structures.
- [SymPy](http://www.sympy.org/), for symbolic mathematics and
  computer algebra.
- [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/), is a collection of tools
  for analyzing complex networks.
- [scikit-image](http://scikit-image.org/) is a collection of
  algorithms for image processing.
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) is a collection of
  algorithms and tools for machine learning.

### Productivity and high-performance computing

- [IPython](http://ipython.org/), a command-line interface to Python,
  for interactively exploring code, processing data, and testing code ideas.
- [Jupyter Lab](http://jupyter.org/) provides computational notebooks
  that combine interactive code with descriptive text in your web
  browser, useful especially for teaching and documenting research.
- [Joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/),
  [Dask](https://dask.readthedocs.io/), or [Ray](https://www.ray.io/)
  for distributed processing with a focus on numerical data.
