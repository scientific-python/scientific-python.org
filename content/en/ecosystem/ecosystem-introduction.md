The Scientific Python ecosystem is a collection of open-source
scientific software packages written in Python. It is a broad and
ever-expanding set of algorithms and data structures that grew around
NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib.

The ecosystem includes a wide variety of tools: some more specialized
to specific domains such as biological imaging or astronomy, and
others quite general for tasks such as data management and
high-performance computing.

It includes projects such as Pandas (for data analysis), NetworkX
(for graph computation), scikit-learn (for machine learning), and
scikit-image (for image processing).

While each project is developed independently and has its own
developer community, there are some features common to all
projects in the ecosystem:

- They are **community-driven**: the developer communities consist largely of
  users.
- They are **open-source with permissive licenses** that guarantee the
  the software is accessible to anyone and can be used without restriction.
- They are **tested extensively** using continuous integration.
- Projects are **thoroughly documented** and use the consistent and readable
  [numpydoc](https://github.com/numpy/numpydoc) docstring format.
