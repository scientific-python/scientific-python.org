There are many different ways to install scientific Python packages. We'll
focus on two recommended methods, specifically:

- `pip` (with the built-in `venv` module for virtual environments)
- `conda`

With both `pip` and `conda`, you can control the package versions for a specific
project to prevent dependency conflicts.
One of the advantages of `pip` is that it is a built-in module of Python and
therefore is ubiquitous and well-supported.
`conda` is a more extensive package manager, which includes the ability to
install and manage non-Python dependencies, such as compilers or other
libraries like MKL or HDF5.
`conda` also doubles as an *environment manager*, allowing users to create and
manage different *virtual environments* for their Python projects.
