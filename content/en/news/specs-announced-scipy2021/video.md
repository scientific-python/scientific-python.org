Hi everyone,

Today, I am excited to introduce to you a new planning effort for
better coordinating the Scientific Python ecosystem.

So, unlike the other talks in this session, this talk is not about one
specific tool, but rather about *all* the tools and how they work
together.

In the early days of the SciPy conference, we had fewer than 50
attendeesâ€”and many of those were core library developers.  So, it was
easy to get everyone around a table and to talk about important decisions
that affected several projects.

But that hasn't been possible for quite some time.  Unsurprisingly then, one of the
concerns we've heard from users is that the ecosystem sometimes lacks
coherence.

And, to address that, we are launching an effort to get projects talking to
one another again, to strategize about their joint future, and to make that future a reality.

-----

Specifically, we have the following aims:

1. to create a mechanism through which the community can
   establish cross-project policies;
2. to improve common engineering infrastructure;
3. to organize topic-focused developer events to uncover needs;
4. to write a community-vetted strategic plan, and
5. to help projects develop their own grant proposals and to get
   funded.

-----

We have started work on the first aim of the project: a
mechanism through which the community can establish cross-project policies.

-----

These policy documents we call SPECs: Scientific Python Ecosystem
Coordination documents.

These documents will function similarly to PEPs, NEPs, SKIPs, or
any of the other enhancement proposals---except that they will be relevant to multiple projects in the ecosystem.

These documents will be recommendations written up by the community,
and their authority will derive from endorsement by popular libraries.

-----

A SPEC has the following lifecycle.

First, it gets discussed on the Scientific Python Discussion Forum.
We hope that this forum will eventually become a gathering place for
many of the projects in the ecosystem.

-----

Once it is clear that the idea has merit, it will become a Markdown
document filed as a pull request on the scientific-python GitHub
repository.

-----

The SPEC will be guided through acceptance stages by community
volunteers, known as the SPEC Steering Committee.

These are the current members of the committee, who have volunteered
their time to help facilitate the SPEC process.

It should be noted that the emphasis is specifically on facilitation,
rather than gatekeeping.  Again, the SPECs will derive their authority
from endorsement by projects in the ecosystem.

-----

We thank these core projects who have agreed to serve as the
initial SPEC endorsers.

-----

If you have a great idea for improving the Scientific Python
ecosystem, please don't hesitate to reach out!

Finally, we look forward to working with you all in bringing the
ecosystem together more closely.

Thank you.
