With an extensive and high-quality ecosystem of libraries, scientific Python
has emerged as the leading platform for data analysis.
This ecosystem is sustained by independent volunteers with separate mailing
lists, websites, roadmaps, documentation, engineering and packaging solutions,
and governance structures.

To better coordinate the ecosystem and prepare scientific Python
for the next decade of data science, we will:

1. Create recommendation infrastructure for community-wide policy,
2. Improve common engineering infrastructure,
3. Organize a series of developer events to discuss needs,
4. Write a community vetted strategic plan, and
5. Help the community develop grant proposals.

Our initial focus is on creating a recommendation infrastructure for
community-wide policy and on improving common engineering infrastructure
(see the [SPEC](https://specs.scientific-python.org) documents).

_This work is funded in part by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation through
grant GBMF8599 to the University of California, Berkeley._
