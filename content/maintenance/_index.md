title: Ecosystem Maintenance
---

We work broadly across the ecosystem to relieve the maintenance burden on community volunteers.
This work is generally along one of three directions: tool building, maintenance, and release management.

## Tools

We maintain a collection of tools, small and large, that help projects across the ecosystem:

- [attach-next-milestone](https://github.com/scientific-python/attach-next-milestone)
- [lazy_loader](https://github.com/scientific-python/lazy_loader/)
- [scientific-python-hugo-theme](https://github.com/scientific-python/scientific-python-hugo-theme)
- [spin](https://github.com/scientific-python/spin)
- [yaml2ics](https://github.com/scientific-python/yaml2ics)

## Maintenance?
