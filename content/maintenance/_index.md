title: Ecosystem Maintenance

We work broadly across the ecosystem to relieve the maintenance burden on community volunteers.
This work is generally along one of three directions: tool building, maintenance, and release management.

## Tools

We maintain a collection of tools, small and large, that help projects across the ecosystem:

### Web theme

### Python packages

- [lazy_loader](https://github.com/scientific-python/lazy_loader/)
