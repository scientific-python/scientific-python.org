# Scientific Python Ecosystem Coordination (SPEC)

{{< notice warning >}}
**WIP:**  We are in the process of developing the SPECs
and recruiting the initial SPEC Steering Committee.
{{< /notice >}} 

SPECs provide operational guidelines for projects in the scientific Python ecosystem.
For details, please review their [purpose and process]({{< relref
"/specs/meta-spec-0000.md" >}}) and how the [governance and decision making]({{<
relref "/specs/meta-spec-0001.md" >}}) works.
We track SPEC endorsements by a set of [core projects]({{< relref
"/specs/meta-spec-0002.md" >}}) to facilitate coordination of the ecosystem.

All projects in the ecosystem are encouraged to participate in the SPEC process
and each individual project is responsible for deciding according to their own
decision making process whether to adopt any specific SPEC.
Contributors must adhere to our [code of conduct]({{< relref "/about/code_of_conduct.md" >}}).
