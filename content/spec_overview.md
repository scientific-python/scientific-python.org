# Scientific Python Ecosystem Coordination (SPEC)

SPECs provide operational guidelines for projects in the scientific Python ecosystem.
For details, please review their [purpose and process]({{< relref
"/specs/meta-spec-0000.md" >}}) and how the [governance and decision making]({{<
relref "/specs/meta-spec-0001.md" >}}) works.
We track SPEC endorsements by the [Core Projects]({{< relref
"/specs/meta-spec-0002.md" >}}) to facilitate both bottom-up and top-down
coordination of the ecosystem.

All projects in the ecosystem are encouraged to participate in the SPEC process
and each individual project is responsible for deciding according to their own
decision making process whether to adopt any specific SPEC.
