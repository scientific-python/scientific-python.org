Scientific Python Ecosystem Coordination documents or SPECs, for short, provide
operational guidelines for projects in the scientific Python ecosystem.

Before submitting a new SPEC, please review their [purpose and process]({{< relref
"/specs/meta-spec-0000.md" >}}) and how the [governance and decision making]({{<
relref "/specs/meta-spec-0001.md" >}}) works.
All projects in the ecosystem are encouraged to participate in the SPEC process
and each individual project is responsible for deciding according to their own
decision making process whether to accept any specific SPEC.
We track SPEC adoption by a small subset of [core projects]({{< relref
"/specs/meta-spec-0002.md" >}}) to faciliates both bottom-up and top-down
coordination of the ecosystem.
