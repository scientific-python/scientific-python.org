What is a SPEC?
===============

Because the SPECs are maintained as text files in a versioned
repository, their revision history is the historical record of the
feature proposal[^1].

Format and Template
===================

SPECs are UTF-8 encoded text files using 

[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) format.

Please see the `spec-template`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} file and
for more information.

We use [Hugo](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to convert SPECs to HTML
for viewing on the web [^2].
