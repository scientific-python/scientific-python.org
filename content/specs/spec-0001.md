  Governance and decision making for the Scientific Python Ecosystem Coordination project.

# Description

The Scientific Python Ecosystem project is a consensus-based community
project. Anyone with an interest in the project can join the community,
contribute to the project design, and participate in the decision making
process. This document describes how that participation takes place, how to
find consensus, and how deadlocks are resolved.

## The Community

The Scientific Python Ecosystem community consists of anyone using or working
with the project in any way.

## Contributors

Any community member can become a contributor by interacting directly
with the project in concrete ways, such as:

-   proposing a change to the code or documentation via a GitHub pull
    request;
-   reporting issues on our [GitHub issues
    page](https://github.com/scientific-python/scientific-python.org/issues);
-   discussing the design of the library, website, or tutorials on the
    [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/networkx-discuss/), or
    in existing issues and pull requests; or
-   reviewing [open pull
    requests](https://github.com/scientific-python/scientific-python.org/issues),

among other possibilities. By contributing to the project, community
members can directly help to shape its future.

Contributors should read our [Code of Conduct]({{< ref
"/about/code_of_conduct.md" >}}).

the smooth running of the project.
SC members are expected to participate in strategic planning, approve
changes to the governance model, and make decisions about funding
granted to the project itself. (Funding to community members is theirs
to pursue and manage.) The purpose of the SC is to ensure smooth
progress from the big-picture perspective. Changes that impact the full
project require analysis informed by long experience with both the
project and the larger ecosystem. When the core developer community
(including the SC members) fails to reach such a consensus in a
reasonable timeframe, the SC is the entity that resolves the issue.

Steering Council members appear as team members on the [NetworkX
Steering Council Team
page](https://github.com/orgs/networkx/teams/steering-council/members)
and can be messaged `@networkx/steering-council`. Core

## Core Team

## Advisory Council

<!--
The Steering Council (SC) members are core developers who have
additional responsibilities to ensure the smooth running of the project.

changes to the governance model, and make decisions about funding
granted to the project itself. (Funding to community members is theirs

# Implementation

Decisions about the future of the project are made through discussion with all
members of the community. All non-sensitive project management discussion takes
place on the [issue
tracker](https://github.com/scientific-python/scientific-python.org/issues).
Sensitive discussions may occur on a private list.

## Scientific Python Ecosystem Coordination (SPEC) mechanism

Any proposals for coordinating the Scientific Python Ecosystem should be
written as a formal SPEC following the [template]({{< ref
"/specs/spec-template.md" >}}). The SPEC must be made public and
discussed before any vote is taken.  The workflow of a SPEC is detailed
[here]({{< ref "/specs/spec-0000.md" >}}).

A list of all existing SPECs is available [here]({{< ref
"/specs/_index.md" >}}).
