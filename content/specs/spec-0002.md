Description
===========

This SPEC recommends that all projects across the Scientific Python
ecosystem adopt a common time-based policy for dropping 
support of older Python, NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib versions.
We recommend that projects drop support for versions of Python 42 months after
its intial release and for versions of NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib 24 months
after their intial releases.

Implementation
==============

Projects adopting this SPEC should create a PR

names to the list below:

Discussion
==========

Historically, many projects were reluctant to drop support for older releases
of Python, NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.
This prevented projects from taking advantage of new features and required
additional logic to handle various software versions.
This increases the burden on developers and prevented users from taking advantage
of recent improvements.

[NEP 29](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html) describes
several alternatives including ad-Hoc version support, all CPython supported
versions, default version on Linux distribution, N minor versions of Python,
and time window from the X.Y.1 Python release.

Notes
=====

- This builds on [NEP 29](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html).
