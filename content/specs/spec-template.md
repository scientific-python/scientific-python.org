# Description

This section should provide a detailed description of the proposed
change. It should include examples of how the new functionality would be
used, intended use-cases and pseudo-code illustrating its use.

Here are some optional subsections of the description that you may
wish to use (with or without the headings).

## Motivation and Scope (optional)

This section describes the need for the proposed change. It should
describe the existing problem, who it affects, what it is trying to
solve, and why. This section should explicitly address the scope of and
key requirements for the proposed change.

## Usage and Impact (optional)

This section describes how users of the scientific Python ecosystem
will use features described in this SPEC.

It should be comprised mainly of code examples that
wouldn't be possible without acceptance and implementation of this
SPEC, as well as the impact the proposed changes would have on the
ecosystem. This section should be written from the perspective of the
users of the scientific Python ecosystem, and the benefits it will
provide them; and as such, it should include implementation details
only if necessary to explain the functionality.

## Backward compatibility (optional)

This section describes the ways in which the SPEC breaks backward
compatibility.

## Related Work (optional)

This section should list relevant and/or similar technologies, possibly
in other libraries. It does not need to be comprehensive, just list the
major examples of prior and relevant art.

# Implementation

This section lists the major steps required to implement the SPEC. Where
possible, it should be noted where one step is dependent on another, and
which steps may be optionally omitted. Where it makes sense, each step
should include a link to related pull requests as the implementation
progresses.

Any pull requests or development branches containing work on this SPEC
should be linked to from here. (A SPEC does not need to be implemented
in a single pull request if it makes sense to implement it in discrete
phases).

## Alternatives (optional)

If there were any alternative solutions to solving the same problem,
they should be discussed here, along with a justification for the chosen
approach.

# Discussion

This section may just be a bullet list including links to any
discussions regarding the SPEC:

-   This includes links to mailing list threads or relevant GitHub
    issues.
