The developer summits address topics of interest across several packages (e.g., sparse arrays, benchmarking, packaging, teaching, specific science domains).
While we also organize some more topic focused developer discussions e.g for the _Domain stacks_ or _Sparse Data_.

We have recordings for some of the developer summit preparation calls, as well as for some more specialized topics.
They are shared on our youtube channel under the [“Developer Discussions” playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7rNFJDy0iz5GGSmRQNMO-qF6PUG3YsQx).

To discuss upcoming summits or suggest potential summit topics, see the [summits category in the discussion forum](https://discuss.scientific-python.org/c/summits/27).
