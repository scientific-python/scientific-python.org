## Funding

Unfortunately, this year we do not have any dedicated funding to cover participants travel and accommodation costs.

Project maintainers, please reach out to your individual projects or employers to determine whether they have funds to sponsor your attendance.

## Logistics

We have space for 20-25 participants for three days.
This will be an invite-only event that requires upfront agreement to:
(a) take part in at least one pre-summit planning meeting,
(b) collaborate with fellow participants on a work plan,
(c) attend the summit in-person, and
(d) participate, to whatever degree possible, in several months of post-summit implementation.

## About

### Work Topics

The 2025 November Scientific Python Developer Summit will focus on work topics our participants express the most interest in. For comparison, these were the focus areas for the summit held in May, in Seattle:

- **Data analysis**: statistics, optimization, sparse data, plotting, and dataframes.
- **SPECS**: Community & governance SPECs, new SPECs, infrastructure & tools, etc.
- **Tools**: CI, build, testing, cookie-cutter, new tools (https://tools.scientific-python.org), etc.
- **Communications & teaching**: devstats, mystmd, lecture notes & learn
- **Security**: supply chain, pull request review, tooling & infrastructure, web of trust

### Dates

The summit is held 5-7 November 2025 in Copenhagen, Denmark.

Attendees should preferably arrive the day before the summit starts, and stay for the entire duration of the summit.

### Pre-Summit Planning

See [planning issues](https://github.com/scientific-python/summit-2025-nov/issues).

Participants will be responsible for attending at least one video meetings and for participating in a planning repository via PRs, issues—as both contributors and reviewers.
There is no heavy top-down structure: participants themselves will organize the work that needs to be done ahead of time.
They will decide on topics, divide the work, and schedule the meeting.

### Summit Execution

The goal of the summit is to be a hands-on work meeting.
That said, there will be some free time scheduled to brainstorm new ideas, and to discuss current community projects and activities.

### Post-Summit Implementation

After the meeting, attendees will collaborate on their assigned tasks until completion.

## Meeting notes

To be posted.
