The event is held at the [eScience Institute, UW Physics/Astronomy Tower, 6th Floor, 3910 15th Ave NE, Seattle](https://goo.gl/maps/EfkoHtvZad3fYMx77).

_A friendly reminder that we are guests of the eScience Institute, and
that some members of their research staff will continue working in the space
during our event._

## Funding

Unlike previous years, participation costs for this year's summit are covered
only for those invited as part of the special track on statistics (for that, we have targeted grant funding).

Project maintainers, please reach out to your individual projects to determine
whether they have funds to sponsor your attendance.

## Logistics

We have space for 40 participants for three days and four nights.
This will be an invite-only event that requires upfront agreement to:
(a) take part in one or more pre-summit planning meetings,
(b) collaborate with fellow participants on a work plan,
(c) attend the summit in-person, and
(d) participate, to whatever degree possible, in several months of post-summit implementation.

### Airport to hotel

There is no need to get a rental car or taxi/ride-share, as the airport and the UW campus area is well-served by bus and rail.
We recommend using Link Light Rail to get from the airport to the hotel. It takes approximately an hour and costs $3.25.
The closest station to the hotel is "U-District" (0.3mi away), which is a new station opened in 2021 and is not to be confused with the station in Downtown called, "University St", neither with "University of Washington".

### Food

Coming soon

### Participants

Participants are recruited from the community of developers of packages
such as NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, xarray, pandas, scikit-image, scikit-learn,
NetworkX, and IPython, as well as domain stacks including Astropy, Pangeo, and
scikit-HEP.

## About

### Goals

The 2025 Scientific Python Developer Summit will focus on statistics, optimization, sparse data, plotting, and dataframes.

The Developer Summit provides an opportunity for core developers
from the scientific Python ecosystem to come together to:

#### 1. Improve joint infrastructure

Collaborate to adopt and improve infrastructure, tools, and processes
used across projects. This includes infrastructure already described
in Scientific Python Ecosystem Coordination documents (SPECs), as well
as, but not limited to, tools for documentation, testing, benchmarking,
packaging, and Continuous Integration (CI).

#### 2. Better coordination of the ecosystem

A central goal of the Scientific Python project and, by implication, the summit, is to better coordinate maintenance of the different projects.

#### 3. Work on shared strategic goals

A strategic plan would identify core needs and future challenges of the scientific Python community.
Rather than focusing on the technical details of one particular project or domain area, the strategic plan would discuss the challenges shared across projects and domains.
The plan can be used by the community as supporting evidence when applying for grants.

### Dates

The summit is held May 11-15, 2025 in Seattle, WA.

Attendees should preferably arrive the day before the summit starts, and stay for the entire duration of the summit.

### Pre-Summit Planning

See [planning issues](https://github.com/scientific-python/summit-2025/issues).

Participants will be responsible for attending two or more one-hour video meetings (the planning meetings mentioned above) and for
participating in a planning repository via PRs, issues—as both contributors and reviewers.
There is no heavy top-down structure: participants themselves will organize the work that needs to be done ahead of time.
They will decide on topics, divide the work, and schedule the meeting.

### Summit Execution

The goal of the summit is to be a hands-on work meeting.
That said, there will be some free time scheduled to brainstorm new ideas, and to discuss current community projects and activities.

### Post-Summit Implementation

After the meeting, attendees will collaborate on their assigned tasks until completion.

## Meeting notes

To be posted.
