The event is held at the [eScience Institute, UW Physics/Astronomy Tower, 6th Floor, 3910 15th Ave NE, Seattle](https://goo.gl/maps/EfkoHtvZad3fYMx77).

_A friendly reminder that we are guests of the eScience Institute, and
that some members of their research staff will continue working in the space
during our event._

## Funding

Unlike previous years, participation costs for this year's summit are covered
only for those invited as part of the special track on statistics (for that, we have targeted grant funding).

Project maintainers, please reach out to your individual projects to determine
whether they have funds to sponsor your attendance.

## Logistics

We have space for 40 participants for three days and four nights.
This will be an invite-only event that requires upfront agreement to:
(a) take part in at least one pre-summit planning meeting,
(b) collaborate with fellow participants on a work plan,
(c) attend the summit in-person, and
(d) participate, to whatever degree possible, in several months of post-summit implementation.

### Airport to hotel

There is no need to get a rental car or taxi/ride-share, as the airport and the UW campus area is well-served by bus and rail.
We recommend using Link Light Rail to get from the airport to the hotel. It takes approximately an hour and costs $3.25.
The closest station to the hotel is "U-District" (0.3mi away), which is a new station opened in 2021 and is not to be confused with the station in Downtown called, "University St", neither with "University of Washington".

### Food

Coming soon

### Participants

Participants are recruited from the community of developers of packages
such as NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, xarray, pandas, scikit-image, scikit-learn,
NetworkX, and IPython, as well as domain stacks including Astropy, Pangeo, and
scikit-HEP.

## About

### Work Topics

The 2025 Scientific Python Developer Summit will focus on the following work topics:

- **Data analysis**: statistics, optimization, sparse data, plotting, and dataframes.
- **SPECS**: Community & governance SPECs, new SPECs, infrastructure & tools, etc.
- **Tools**: CI, build, testing, cookie-cutter, new tools (https://tools.scientific-python.org), etc.
- **Communications & teaching**: devstats, mystmd, lecture notes & learn
- **Security**: supply chain, pull request review, tooling & infrastructure, web of trust

### Dates

The summit is held May 11-14, 2025 in Seattle, WA.

Attendees should preferably arrive the day before the summit starts, and stay for the entire duration of the summit.

### Pre-Summit Planning

See [planning issues](https://github.com/scientific-python/summit-2025/issues).

Participants will be responsible for attending at least one video meetings and for participating in a planning repository via PRs, issues—as both contributors and reviewers.
There is no heavy top-down structure: participants themselves will organize the work that needs to be done ahead of time.
They will decide on topics, divide the work, and schedule the meeting.

### Summit Execution

The goal of the summit is to be a hands-on work meeting.
That said, there will be some free time scheduled to brainstorm new ideas, and to discuss current community projects and activities.

### Post-Summit Implementation

After the meeting, attendees will collaborate on their assigned tasks until completion.

## Meeting notes

To be posted.
