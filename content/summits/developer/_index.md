title: "Developer Summits"

Scientific Python Developer Summits are focused, in-person, invitation-only gatherings of core developers and maintainers from across the ecosystem.
These are working meetings---not beginner-oriented events---and they typically do not include talks or tutorials.
Instead, summits provide a collaborative and self-organized space to make progress on shared technical challenges, strengthen coordination between projects, and advance the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem.

Participants coordinate in advance to identify priorities and plan concrete work, ensuring that in-person time is spent effectively.
Work at summits often involves improving joint infrastructure (e.g., testing, packaging, documentation), aligning developer practices (e.g., governance, release management, community guides), and developing a shared strategic plan to guide the future of scientific Python.

To qualify as a Developer Summit, the event should:

- Convene core developers and maintainers from multiple scientific Python projects.
- Be participant-driven and self-organized, with priorities set by attendees.
- Allocate time for both concrete technical work and higher-level strategic planning.
- Focus on issues with cross-project impact rather than those of a single package.
