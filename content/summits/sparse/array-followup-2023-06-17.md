## Notes

- Introduction, Erik works on libraries using sparse datastructures
  - [Julien] Erik: here is [the worklog of the summit](https://hackmd.io/iEtdfbxfSbGwOAJTXmqyIQ)

### What remains to be done

- How do we work
  - [Dan] Where does in-progress work go
    - CJ's fork, make PRs onto branch there
    - Using the view on the diff on GitHub might prevent the creation of spurious Draft PR
  - Dense pretending to be sparse can be ephermeral, never needs to go to scipy
  - Dan will make a branch for exploration that people can fork and make PRs to. Dan will try to keep it up-to-date with the main branch too.
- 1d sparse array support
  Timeline? - Dan + CJ working on it - Targeting 1.12
- nd sparse array support
  - Julien, CJ: seems like low priority and this would be a huge maintenance cost SciPy for relatively rare use-cases
  - CJ: Array api makes interop easier, we can lean on external packages for now
- creation functions [scipy#18592](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/18592)
  - Want to get them out in a single release
  - Is Ross going to implement these, or need to assign elsewhere?
  - Current plan: `_array` methods, so we can apply this to the fast_matrix_market io at the same type
  - Bundling in api changes (like tuples for shapes)
- Deprecate `isspmatrix_` methods?
  - Sounds like combination of classes + format attribute cover this
  - (Julien) Deprecation plan: have suggested code to replace these things with
  - Add a section in the documentation explaining the change of semantic and a migration plan for downstream libraries during the deprecation cycle.
    - Make a roadmap for array api
- scikit-learn
  - When will scikit-learn be willing to support a compatible version of scipy?
    - Julien:
      - reasoning is based on some linux package manager not supporting latest numpy scipy
      - Personally would like scikit-learn to follow SPEC 0
      - See discussion for [1.3](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/26438)
      - [Dedicated RFC](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/26418)
      - Some part of scikit-learn's behavior depends on SciPy's version (e.g. see [this one](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/784ba9ef9f65d5e4e33087dd7f5b87d65b605efc/sklearn/preprocessing/_polynomial.py#L61-L73)); we might potentially rely on similar mechanism for the support of sparse arrays (e.g. reshaping outputs)
      - scikit-learn uses nightly builds to test the developer version of SciPy and NumPy and failing tests are updated in [this issue](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/26154). We can watch those for breakage in scikit-learn when we make changes in SciPy.
- General speed ups
  - "Fast path for canonical"
    - TODO (Isaac)
      - Figure out canonical for all the formats, probably normalize APIs
      - Add keyword public argument for constructors

## Broad plan for deprecation

- Add support for sparse_arrays everywhere we can
  - Creation functions: target 1.12
  - 1d COO: target 1.12
- Deprecate spmatrix-specific functions (where there's an easy replacement)
  - Target: 1.12
- Once everything works with sparse arrays, then deprecate spmatrix
  - And the sparse array API is stable! (specifically, 1d support)
  - Target: 1.13

## Actionable items

- [Julien] Add a section in the documentation explaining the change of semantic and a migration plan for downstream libraries during the deprecation cycle.
- [Julien] Drop `isspmatrix_-` checks in scikit-learn and use `issparse` and `format`

## Next meeting date and time

- Every two weeks with the option to drop every other meeting (at least once a month)
  > [name=Julien] +1. I proposed to meet every two week for 1h on the same timeslot
