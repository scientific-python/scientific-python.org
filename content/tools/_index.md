- attribute copyright to `Scientific Python Developers`;
- follow our [Code of Conduct](https://scientific-python.org/code_of_conduct/);
- use the [Scientific Python GitHub Organization](https://github.com/scientific-python/) to host their source code repository; and
- provide general functionality needed by projects or packages across the ecosystem.

### Web theme

Our [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme is used by [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [SciPy](https://scipy.org/),

## New tools

If you have an existing tool that you would like to host and maintain as part of the Scientific Python project,
please [create a New Topic](https://discuss.scientific-python.org/new-topic?category=contributor&tags=propose)
describing your tool, its target audience, and its developer community.

We only host tools that are actively maintained, and will give your existing
developer community full access to continue managing your repository.
