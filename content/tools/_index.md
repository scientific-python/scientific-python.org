## New tools

If you have an existing tool that you would like to contribute to the Scientific Python project,
please [create a New Topic](https://discuss.scientific-python.org/new-topic?category=contributor&tags=propose)
describing your tool and it developer community.

Typically, we will only accept tools that are actively maintained and will work with you to give your
existing developer community full access to continue managing your reposistory.
